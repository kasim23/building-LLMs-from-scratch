    "A dot product is essentially a concise way of multiplying two vectors element-wise and then summing the products. The output confirms that the sum of the element-wise multiplication gives the same results as the dot product. Beyond viewing the dot product operation as a mathematical tool that combines two vectors to yield a scalar value, the dot product is a measure of similarity because it quantifies how closely two vectors are aligned: a higher dot product indicates a greater degree of alignment or similarity between the vectors. In the context of self-attention mechanisms, the dot product determines the extent to which each element in a sequence focuses on, or “attends to,” any other element: the higher the dot product, the higher the similarity and attention score between two elements."

Note that this naive softmax implementation (softmax_naive) may encounter numerical instability problems, such as overflow and underflow, when dealing with large or small input values.
